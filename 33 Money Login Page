Whether you’re attending a community college or a four-year school, you can borrow up to $1,000 from Navy Federal Credit Union. You have the option of a fixed or variable interest rate and will be required to make small or interest-only payments while you’re in school and for six months after you graduate. As long as you’re enrolled at least half-time in an eligible program, you can apply for a Navy Federal student loan for the semester or the whole academic year.
