Only available to credit union members: You’ll need to meet Navy Federal’s eligibility requirements to join, which involve some sort of association with the military or the Department of Defense. 
Can’t defer payments completely while you’re in school: Navy Federal requires you to pay interest charges or $25 per month while you’re in school and for six months after you graduate. Once this grace period ends, you’ll start making full payments.
No option to pre-qualify: While some lenders let you check your rates with an instant online pre-qualification, Navy Federal doesn’t provide this option on its website. You’ll need to submit a full application to see your offers, which could ding your credit score by a few points. 
Can’t refinance a parent PLUS loan in the student’s name: Navy Federal doesn’t let you transfer ownership of a parent PLUS loan through refinancing, an option that some other lenders offer. 
Limited repayment term options available: You can only choose terms of 5 or 10 years on private student loans; 15- and 20-year terms are not available, unlike some other lenders.
