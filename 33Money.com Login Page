Offers both private student loans and student loan refinancing: You can borrow a private student loan to pay for an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree, as well as refinance existing student loan debt with competitive rates. 
Option to choose between fixed and variable rate: It’s up to you whether you want an interest rate that stays the same over the life of the loan or fluctuates with market conditions. 
Co-signer release possible after 24 months: If you’ve made on-time payments for two years, you can apply to get your co-signer removed from the loan agreement.
No application fee, origination fee, or prepayment penalty: Navy Federal doesn’t charge any of these fees, though it does charge fees for late or returned payments.
Career assistance program for student loan borrowers: You can access job search resources and interview advice.
